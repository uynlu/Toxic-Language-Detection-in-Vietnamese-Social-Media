- Implicit
    - Implicitness means that the toxic content of the given text is subtle or indirect, so it cannot be obvious as abusive or hateful easily or immediately.
    - It uses figurative language, sarcasm, irony, wordplay, cultural references, euphemisms, indirect references, or even humor expression to convey toxic meaning.
    - In this case, recognizing the toxicity requires cultural or contextual knowledge to understand the true harmful intent.
